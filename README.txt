|BROKER| is an azekill_DIABLO software
|######| # use at your own risks ! #
|______| made for Windows (7, 8, 10)

Â¤ Finally a small but efficient file destroyer!
		- the author of the software ;o;

#README! IM IMPORTANT: 

> What is that?
An utility tool to permanently destroy all the files of the current folder.
Warning! Does not delete the subfolders. (For now, I think it will change.)

> How to use it?
Copy/Paste it in the folder, execute it and answer to the safety check:
- "Are you sure?"
by entering the letters indicated, (Y/N) by default. 
The letters changes with the language of the PC.
It works like this: ( "AFFIRMATIVE" / "NEGATIVE" ), but only happens if you
have this in your broker.bat file:

del *.* cls
^This is the default config.

> Why creating this? 
I didn't liked the restrictions on Windows while deleting files, so I created a
powerful and simple (9 characters. lol.) tool, that totally erase, broke, annihilate
files from your computer. No more deleted files comebacks with Broker. It even 
destroys himself. So prepare some copys of broker.bat to don't have to download
the files again.

> Is it dangerous?
For sure! A simple code like in this software does not garranty any protections to 
your files. But the fact it doesn't touch to subfolders make it safer to use. You 
MUST understand that i'm not responsible of any loss of files or data. 
Take care while using it. Just know that i'm sorry if such things happens to you. 

> Is there more to it?
Sure! You can learn to Broker new orders! Open the broker.bat with a text editor
like 'notepad' or 'notepad++' and you will see this:

del *.* cls

You can change the first * to a filename:

del item_mod.* cls
^This will destroy files called item_mod, without checking their extensions.

You can change the second * to an extension name (.exe, .txt, .jpg, .whatever)

del *.exe cls
^This will destroy files with the .exe extension, without checking their names.

Finally you can combine those two "superpowers" to use them at the same time:

del minecraft.exe cls
^This will destroy minecraft.exe files only.

And then play (no, no, no, you will kill your PC) and combine different functions:

del doom.* cls
del *.exe cls
del mig.dll cls
^It works!

I hope you will find Broker useful! Remenber to take care while using it!
